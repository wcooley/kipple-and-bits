<para>The home page of TileCache is <ulink type="http"
url="http://www.tilecache.org">tilecache.org</ulink>, where the source can 
be retrieved for installation. At the time of this writing, the current
release is version 1.9 and options may vary with different releases.</para>

<para>To get started, we are going to assume a vanilla Red Hat-type operating
system, such as Fedora 8, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 or CentOS 5. It is assumed that Apache and Python are installed and that defaults are largely unchanged. Although we will install into your home directory,  it is necessary to make minor
modifications to system configuration files, so it will be necessary on a
few occasions to have root access, either through su or sudo.</para>

<title>Apache Configuration</title>
        
<para>To get started, we will install into the <filename>public_html/</filename>
directory in our home directory. If this directory exists and Apache is configured correctly, it's contents are accessible through a web browser. Red Hat, however, ships with this facility disabled, so we must first enable it. As root, edit the file <filename>/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf</filename> and change the line
<screen>
    UserDir disable
</screen>
to
<screen>
    UserDir public_html
</screen>
