STYLE
=====

    o Get some real icons!

    o Document key data structures (user, group, etc.)

    o Clarify abstractions between directory-agnostic functions,
    directory-specific functions, and presentation.

OPERATIONAL
===========

    @ User management:
        o User search.
        o User modification.
        o Need checking for attempt to change uid.
        o Delete group when removing user.
        o LDAP MD5 & SHA passwords.
        o Samba attributes for users.
        o Home directory creation.
        o Automatic home directories like useradmin.
        o Selectable OU for users.

    @ Group management.
        o Almost everything; some things implemented for
        users.

    @ Host management.
        o Everything.

    @ Alias management.
        o Everything.  Will Postfix even use the NSS alias
            database?

    @ Hosts management.
        o Everything.

    @ Figure out, plan for, and implement Postfix map management.
