What works currently:

    o Document key data structures (user, group, etc.) (Every
    function is documented and user and group LDAP and hashes
    are documented.)

    @ User creation:
        o Auto-selecting of next UID.
        o Auto-creation of group for user.
        o User listing, sorting rows by columns.
        o Set allowed hosts attribute for users.
        o User modification.
        o Need checking for attempt to change uid (work around
          temporarily by making userName, groupID, and userID not
          changable in edit form).
        o User search.
        o LDAP MD5, SMD5, SSHA & SHA passwords.
        o Password change form.

STYLE
=====

    o Get some real icons!

    o Document key data structures (user, group, etc.)

    o Clarify abstractions between directory-agnostic functions,
    directory-specific functions, and presentation.  Need to move
    some functions from users.pl to ldap_users.pl and vice versa.

OPERATIONAL
===========

    @ User management:
        o Remove user from existing groups.
        o Delete group when removing user.
        o Samba attributes for users.
        o Home directory creation & deletion.
        o Automatic home directories like useradmin.
        o Selectable OU for users.
        o Ability to change userName, groupID, userID.

    @ Group management.
        o Almost everything; some things implemented for
        users.

    @ Host management.
        o Everything.

    @ Alias management.
        o Everything.  Will Postfix even use the NSS alias
            database?

    @ Hosts management.
        o Everything.

    @ Figure out, plan for, and implement Postfix map management.
