Scripts here:

    o cpanpack - A script to download sources from CPAN and generate an
        RPM spec file.  Uses a template spec file (at the end of the script)
        and is cleaner than cpan2rpm.

    o rpmrelease - A script to automate building, signing and publishing RPMs.  

    o rpmdeptree - Shows the packages dependent on the listed packages,
        including specifically what part is dependend upon.
