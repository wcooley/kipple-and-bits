* Done List for Directory_Mgr *

What works currently:

    o Document key data structures (user, group, etc.) (Every
    function is documented and user and group LDAP and hashes
    are documented.)

    @ User creation:
        o Auto-selecting of next UID.
        o Auto-creation of group for user.
        o User listing, sorting rows by columns.
        o Set allowed hosts attribute for users.
        o User modification.
        o Need checking for attempt to change uid (work around
          temporarily by making userName, groupID, and userID not
          changable in edit form).
        o User search.
        o LDAP MD5, SMD5, SSHA & SHA passwords.
        o Password change form.

    @ Group managment:
        o Group listing.
        o Delete group.
        o Add group.
        o Modify group.
        o Search for group.

STYLE
=====

    o Get some real icons!

    o Document key data structures (user, group, etc.)

    o Clarify abstractions between directory-agnostic functions,
    directory-specific functions, and presentation.  Need to move
    some functions from users.pl to ldap_users.pl and vice versa.

    o Better separation between HTML and functions.

OPERATIONAL
===========

    @ User management:
        o Secondary groups.
        o Remove user from existing groups.
        o Delete group when removing user.

        o Shadow attributes for users.
        o FreeRADIUS attributes for users.
        o Samba attributes for users.
        o Home directory creation & deletion.
        o Automatic home directories like useradmin.
        o Selectable OU for users.
        o Ability to change userName, groupID, userID.
        o Removing hosts from user doesn't remove them.
        o Sort users in listing.

    @ Group management.
        o Removing users from group doesn't remove them.
        o Remove member from group.
        o Delete group if empty.

    @ Host management.
        o Everything.

    @ Alias management.
        o Everything.  Will Postfix even use the NSS alias
            database, or do I need special entries?

    @ Hosts management.
        o Everything.

    @ Figure out, plan for, and implement Postfix map management.
